# NumPy ðŸ§®

## About
This section is dedicated to mastering the **NumPy** library. The journey includes theoretical lessons, practical exercises, and small projects demonstrating real-world applications.

## Structure
- **theory/**: Jupyter Notebooks covering all essential topics of NumPy.
- **exercises/**: Practice notebooks with varying difficulty levels (basic, intermediate, advanced).
- **projects/**: Mini projects to apply learned skills in practical scenarios.

## Progress
I update this section daily with new content, exercises, and solutions.

## Next Steps
After completing the **NumPy** section, I will proceed to **pandas**, building on the foundations established here.
